## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Development

**NON-NEGOTIABLE**: Security and privacy are paramount in legal technology.

- All document data MUST be encrypted at rest (AES-256 minimum) and in transit (TLS 1.3+)
- AI API calls MUST NOT expose client names, case numbers, or identifying information without explicit user consent and audit logging
- Authentication MUST support enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- All data access MUST be logged with user identity, timestamp, resource accessed, and action performed
- Access logs MUST be immutable and retained per jurisdictional requirements (minimum 7 years)
- Third-party integrations MUST undergo security review before deployment
- API keys and credentials MUST be stored in secure vaults, never in code or configuration files

**Rationale**: Legal documents contain privileged attorney-client communications and sensitive case information. Any security breach could violate professional ethics rules, expose clients to harm, and create liability for the platform and its users. This principle is derived from both technical security best practices and legal professional responsibility standards.

### II. AI Provider Abstraction

**REQUIRED**: The platform must remain provider-agnostic to ensure flexibility, avoid vendor lock-in, and maintain service continuity.

- Core document editing and management features MUST function independently of any specific AI provider
- AI integration MUST use an adapter/provider pattern with a unified internal interface
- Switching AI providers (Claude ↔ ChatGPT ↔ GLM ↔ others) MUST NOT require document migration or data restructuring
- Provider-specific features (e.g., Claude's extended context) MAY be exposed as optional enhancements with graceful degradation
- AI responses MUST include provider attribution and reasoning/source citations when available
- Provider failures MUST NOT crash the application; fallback providers or offline mode MUST be available
- New providers MUST be integratable through configuration, not code changes to core business logic

**Rationale**: The AI landscape evolves rapidly. Provider pricing, availability, and capabilities change. Legal practices have different provider preferences based on jurisdiction, budget, and compliance requirements. Lock-in to a single provider creates business risk and limits market opportunities.

### III. Document Integrity & Audit Trail

**NON-NEGOTIABLE**: Legal documents require absolute traceability and verifiable history.

- Every document modification MUST be versioned with timestamp (UTC), user identity, and change description
- AI-generated or AI-suggested content MUST be visually and programmatically distinguishable from human-authored content
- Document version history MUST be immutable; deletions MUST be soft-deletes with retention of full history
- Version history MUST be cryptographically signed to prevent tampering (HMAC or digital signatures)
- Document exports MUST preserve full audit metadata in standard formats (PDF/A with embedded metadata, DOCX with track changes)
- Rollback to previous versions MUST be auditable (who rolled back, when, and why)
- Concurrent editing conflicts MUST be detected and logged; last-write-wins is NOT acceptable

**Rationale**: Legal documents serve as evidence in disputes, regulatory proceedings, and litigation. Courts and ethics boards require proof of document authenticity and change history. Malpractice claims may hinge on proving what advice was given and when. Without immutable audit trails, the platform cannot meet professional and evidentiary standards.

### IV. Integration Layer Architecture

**REQUIRED**: External integrations must be isolated, resilient, and non-blocking.

- All external integrations (Google Drive, Microsoft 365, MCP knowledge bases, Chrome extensions) MUST use the adapter pattern with standardized internal interfaces
- Integration failures MUST NOT block core document editing functionality; the editor must work offline or with degraded features
- Integration data MUST be cached locally with configurable TTL to enable offline operation and reduce API costs
- Rate limits and quotas from external services MUST be respected; retry logic MUST use exponential backoff
- Integration health MUST be monitored with circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
- New integrations MUST be pluggable through configuration and dependency injection, not hard-coded dependencies
- Data synchronization conflicts (e.g., document edited in both Drive and platform) MUST be detected and presented to users for resolution

**Rationale**: Legal professionals often work in environments with unreliable internet (courtrooms, client offices, travel). External services (Drive, Office 365) experience outages. MCP knowledge bases may be slow or unavailable. The platform's core value—document editing—must remain available regardless of integration status. Clean architecture also accelerates integration development and testing.

### V. Template System & Domain Knowledge

**REQUIRED**: Legal templates and AI recommendations must be accurate, jurisdiction-aware, and verifiable.

- Legal document templates MUST include jurisdiction metadata (country, state/province, practice area)
- Templates MUST support parameterization and customization without requiring code changes
- AI-generated legal recommendations MUST include citations to source material (case law, statutes, regulations, legal treatises)
- AI responses MUST indicate confidence levels or uncertainty when making legal suggestions
- Knowledge base queries MUST return structured results with source attribution (case name, citation, publication date)
- Templates and knowledge bases MUST support versioning; outdated legal precedents must be flagged
- Before deployment, new templates MUST be reviewed by licensed attorneys in the target jurisdiction
- AI hallucinations or errors MUST be reportable by users with feedback loops to improve accuracy

**Rationale**: Legal accuracy is not optional. Incorrect legal advice can result in malpractice liability, client harm, and loss of professional licensure. Different jurisdictions have different laws (California vs. New York, US vs. EU). Legal precedents change over time. AI models are prone to hallucinations. The platform must combine AI capabilities with human oversight and robust source verification to meet professional standards.

## Compliance & Legal Requirements

**Data Privacy Regulations**:
- MUST comply with GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and equivalent privacy laws in deployment jurisdictions
- Users MUST have rights to data access, correction, deletion, and portability
- Data processing agreements MUST be in place with all AI providers and integration partners
- Cross-border data transfers MUST comply with applicable frameworks (e.g., EU-US Data Privacy Framework)

**Attorney-Client Privilege Protection**:
- Platform architecture MUST preserve attorney-client privilege; no unauthorized access to privileged communications
- AI processing of privileged documents MUST occur in privilege-preserving contexts (no training on client data without consent)
- Metadata MUST NOT leak privileged information (e.g., document titles in external service logs)

**Jurisdictional Awareness**:
- The platform MUST support multi-jurisdictional deployments with jurisdiction-specific configurations
- Legal content (templates, knowledge bases) MUST be tagged with applicable jurisdictions
- Regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., data residency, retention periods) MUST be configurable per jurisdiction

**Professional Liability Safeguards**:
- AI-generated content MUST include disclaimers that it does not constitute legal advice without attorney review
- Platform terms of service MUST clarify liability boundaries between platform and legal professionals
- Error reporting and incident response procedures MUST be documented and tested

## Quality & Testing Standards

**AI Output Validation**:
- AI-generated legal content MUST be validated against known-correct test cases before release
- AI provider updates MUST be regression-tested with a standard test suite of legal documents and queries
- Hallucinations and factual errors MUST be tracked and reported to AI providers

**Legal Accuracy Testing**:
- New templates MUST be reviewed by licensed attorneys with domain expertise
- Knowledge base integrations MUST be tested for citation accuracy and source verification
- Edge cases (ambiguous laws, conflicting precedents) MUST have defined handling procedures

**Performance Requirements**:
- Document loading: MUST render documents <2 seconds for files up to 50 pages
- AI response times: MUST return initial AI suggestions within 5 seconds (streaming responses acceptable)
- Search queries: MUST return knowledge base results within 3 seconds
- Concurrent users: MUST support at least 100 concurrent editors without degradation

**User Acceptance Testing**:
- New features MUST be tested by practicing attorneys before general release
- Usability issues identified in UAT MUST be prioritized for resolution
- Accessibility MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for users with disabilities

## Development Workflow

**Code Review Process**:
- All code changes MUST be peer-reviewed before merging
- Security-sensitive code (authentication, encryption, data access) MUST be reviewed by security-trained engineers
- AI integration logic MUST be reviewed for prompt injection vulnerabilities and data leakage risks

**Security Scanning Gates**:
- Automated security scans (SAST, dependency scanning) MUST run on every pull request
- Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities MUST be fixed before merging
- Secrets scanning MUST prevent accidental commit of credentials or API keys

**Deployment Procedures**:
- Production deployments MUST follow a staged rollout process (canary → staged → full)
- Database migrations MUST be tested in staging environments with production-scale data
- Deployment rollbacks MUST be executable within 15 minutes
- Deployment windows MUST avoid peak legal practice hours (e.g., court filing deadlines)

**Emergency Rollback Protocols**:
- Critical issues (data corruption, security breaches, complete service outages) MUST trigger immediate rollback
- Rollback decision authority MUST be documented (on-call engineer + product lead)
- Post-rollback incident reviews MUST be conducted within 48 hours

## Governance

**Amendment Process**:
- Constitutional amendments MUST be proposed in writing with justification
- Major amendments (adding/removing principles) require approval from product lead and technical architect
- Security and compliance principles REQUIRE legal counsel review before amendment
- Amendments MUST be versioned using semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

**Compliance Verification**:
- All feature specifications MUST include a "Constitution Check" section verifying alignment with principles
- Implementation plans MUST document any constitutional deviations and provide justification
- Quarterly constitution compliance audits MUST be conducted and documented

**Exception Approval Authority**:
- Security-First Development (Principle I): Exceptions require Chief Security Officer approval
- Document Integrity (Principle III): Exceptions require legal counsel approval
- Other principles: Exceptions require product lead and technical architect approval
- All exceptions MUST be documented with rationale, risk assessment, and mitigation plan

**Version Tracking & History**:
- The constitution version MUST be referenced in all specification and planning documents
- Breaking changes to constitutional principles require MAJOR version increment
- New principles or expanded guidance require MINOR version increment
- Clarifications, wording improvements, and non-semantic changes require PATCH version increment

**Agent-Specific Guidance**:
- Runtime development guidance for AI coding assistants MUST be maintained in `CLAUDE.md` (for Claude Code) or equivalent agent-specific files
- Agent guidance MUST reference this constitution and MUST NOT contradict constitutional principles
- Agent guidance updates MUST maintain consistency with constitution version
