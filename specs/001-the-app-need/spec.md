## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A legal professional (attorney, paralegal, or legal assistant) logs into the mind.law platform to draft a contract for a client. They open a new document in the central editor pane, select a jurisdiction-appropriate contract template from the left menu bar, and begin customizing it with client-specific details. As they write, they use the AI chat panel on the right to ask questions like "What are the standard indemnification clauses for California employment agreements?" The AI responds with cited recommendations from case law and statutes. The attorney selects relevant suggestions, which are inserted into the document with clear AI attribution. Throughout the editing session, the system automatically versions every change with timestamps and user attribution. When complete, the attorney exports the final contract with a full audit trail showing all edits, AI suggestions, and human decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a logged-in attorney has opened a blank document, **When** they select "New Commercial Lease - California" from the template menu, **Then** the editor populates with the template content, the document is saved with version 1.0, and the audit log records the template selection with timestamp and user identity.

2. **Given** an attorney is editing a contract and has highlighted a paragraph, **When** they ask the AI chat "Is this force majeure clause enforceable in New York?", **Then** the AI responds within 5 seconds with a cited answer referencing relevant case law, and the conversation is saved to the document's AI interaction history.

3. **Given** two attorneys from the same law firm (same tenant) are working on different documents, **When** both access the platform simultaneously, **Then** each sees only their own documents in the menu, their edits are isolated from each other, and tenant-level billing tracks both sessions under the same account.

4. **Given** an attorney has made 15 edits to a document over 3 days with AI assistance, **When** they click "Export with Audit Trail", **Then** the exported file includes the full document history showing each version, who made changes, which changes were AI-suggested vs. human-authored, and all timestamps in UTC.

5. **Given** an attorney is editing a document offline (no internet connection), **When** they type content and format text, **Then** the editor continues to function normally without AI features, changes are saved locally, and sync resumes automatically when connectivity returns.

6. **Given** an attorney wants to change AI providers for a document, **When** they select "Switch AI Provider" from ChatGPT to Claude, **Then** the existing document and conversation history remain intact, future AI queries use the new provider, and provider attribution updates accordingly.

### Edge Cases

- **Multi-tenant isolation failure**: What happens when a security bug exposes one tenant's documents to another tenant? [System MUST detect and block unauthorized access, log the attempt, trigger security alerts]

- **AI hallucination in legal advice**: How does the system handle when AI provides incorrect or fabricated legal citations? [Users MUST be able to report errors, AI responses MUST include confidence indicators, system MUST track hallucination reports]

- **Concurrent editing conflict**: What happens when two users from the same tenant edit the same document simultaneously? [System MUST detect conflicts, prevent last-write-wins, present conflict resolution UI to users]

- **Document export with corrupted audit trail**: How does system handle when version history becomes inconsistent or cryptographic signatures fail validation? [System MUST refuse export, alert administrators, preserve raw data for forensic analysis]

- **AI provider outage**: What happens when all configured AI providers are unavailable? [Editor MUST remain functional, AI chat MUST display clear offline message, system MUST queue queries for retry or allow manual fallback]

- **Exceeding storage quota**: What happens when a tenant reaches their document storage limit? [System MUST warn at 80% capacity, block new uploads at 100%, preserve existing documents, prompt upgrade]

- **GDPR data deletion request**: How does system handle when a user exercises right to be forgotten? [System MUST soft-delete user data, preserve audit trails for legal retention, anonymize user references in shared documents]
